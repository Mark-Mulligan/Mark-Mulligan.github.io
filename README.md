# Mark Mulligan

## About Me
Hi!  I'm Mark, a full stack developer based in Dallas, TX.
<br>
<br>
I enjoy all aspects of developing, whether it is creating amazing
user interfaces, building custom APIs, setting up an express
server, or organzing and working with databases. I like to build
practical projects that help make people's lives easier.
<br>
<br>
I currently work with the MERN Stack (mongoDB, Express.js,
React.js, and Node.js), but I am always learning something new. I
am also well versed in SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Jquery, and
Bootstrap.
